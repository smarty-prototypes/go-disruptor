## TODO Items:

### Metrics

- Max number of messages/events to handle per invocation to Handle()

### No panic recovery in consumers

If a `Handler.Handle()` panics, it kills the goroutine. `defer waiter.Done()` in `compositeListener.Listen()` fires, but
the panic propagates and crashes the process. The Java LMAX has `ExceptionHandler` on `BatchEventProcessor` that catches
exceptions, invokes a callback, and optionally continues. Here, a single misbehaving handler takes down everything with
no hook point.

### `sharedSequencer.Reserve`—irrevocable reservation blocks forever on shutdown

`sequencer_shared.go:80`: `this.reservedSequence.Add(slots)` is irrevocable. If the buffer is full and `Close()` is
called (consumers stop draining), the producer spins in the slow-path loop forever. There's no exit path—the wait
strategy has no cancellation signal, and the loop has no check for closed state. Java's `MultiProducerSequencer.next()`
uses a CAS loop that could be made interruptible; the `Add` approach here trades that for throughput.

This is the most dangerous issue in the codebase. A producer calling `Reserve` on a full buffer after `Close()` will
hang the goroutine permanently.

### Cache line layout is x86-centric

`defaultSequencer` is annotated as "64B total — one cache line" and `sharedSequencer` as "128B — two cache lines." On
Apple Silicon (128B lines), both structs fit in a single cache line, which means the hot/cold field separation in
`sharedSequencer` provides no isolation. On 32B platforms (ARM32, MIPS), `defaultSequencer` spans two cache lines and
the hot fields straddle the boundary. The code is correct everywhere but the performance optimization only works as
intended on x86.

### `newSequence()` retry loop is unbounded

`sequence.go:15`: The allocation loop retries `new(atomicSequence)` until it gets a cache-line-aligned pointer, with no
iteration limit. Go's allocator will almost always return aligned pointers for these sizes, but there's no guarantee.
An allocation failure or pathological allocator behavior would spin forever. A bounded retry with an
over-allocate-and-align fallback would be more robust.

### Error sentinels as magic int64 values

`ErrReservationSize = -1` and `ErrCapacityUnavailable = -2` are bare int64 constants, not `error` types. A caller that
forgets to check the return value will use -1 or -2 as a sequence number, silently indexing the ring buffer at
`(-1 & mask)` or `(-2 & mask)`—corrupting data with no signal. Java throws `InsufficientCapacityException`. The current
API makes misuse easy and silent.

### Redundant barrier check for first handler group

In `listener.go:60`, for the first handler group, `upstreamBarrier` and `committedBarrier` are the same object (both set
to `committedBarrier` in `config.go:34`). So the gated branch (`else if upperSequence = this.committedBarrier.Load(...)`)
is unreachable for group 0—it will always return the same result as the first check. Minor waste, not a bug.

### Release/acquire semantics for `committedSlots` via `go:linkname`

`sharedSequencer.committedSlots` is the only Commit→Load ordering edge in the shared producer, but is currently typed as
`[]atomic.Int32`—every `Store`/`Load` pays sequential-consistency cost. The pairwise Commit→Load relationship only
requires release/acquire. The `load-acquire` branch (commit `bc78c07`) prototypes this by changing the field to
`[]uint32` and reaching into the runtime via `go:linkname` to call `internal/runtime/atomic.LoadAcq` / `StoreRel`
directly:

```go
//go:linkname loadAcq32 internal/runtime/atomic.LoadAcq
func loadAcq32(ptr *uint32) uint32

//go:linkname storeRel32 internal/runtime/atomic.StoreRel
func storeRel32(ptr *uint32, val uint32)
```

Measured ~3-5% throughput improvement on the single-slot Reserve path on Apple M5 (ARM64, weakly-ordered); negligible on
batched `ReserveMany` paths because the per-slot Commit/Load loop is amortized. On x86 (TSO) the gain would be near
zero, since plain loads/stores already imply acquire/release semantics there.

Reasons it lives in a branch rather than `master`:

- **Internal package path.** `internal/runtime/atomic` is internal to the Go runtime, and was itself renamed from
  `runtime/internal/atomic` in Go 1.26. `LoadAcq` and `StoreRel` are not declared with matching `//go:linkname`
  directives on the runtime side, so we are reaching across the boundary one-directionally—any future restructuring
  breaks the build with no deprecation warning.
- **Race detector.** Switching off `sync/atomic` types makes `go test -race` report false positives on legitimate ring
  buffer reads/writes, because the linkname'd functions are invisible to the race instrumentation.
- **Audience.** A 3-5% gain on one architecture for one access pattern is narrow; it would need to outweigh losing
  race-detector coverage for everyone.

A more durable path forward would be either first-class `LoadAcquire` / `StoreRelease` operations in `sync/atomic`
(proposed but not landed as of Go 1.26), or per-arch assembly stubs colocated in this package so the race detector still
sees the operations.

### Compared to Java LMAX—missing features

| Feature                                                  | Java LMAX                             | This port                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **WorkerPool** (events partitioned across handlers)      | Yes                                   | No—fan-out only (every handler sees every event) |
| **Handler panic/exception recovery**                     | `ExceptionHandler` callback           | Process crash                                    |
| **Dependency DAGs**                                      | Arbitrary via `SequenceBarrier`       | Linear pipeline only                             |
| **Blocking Reserve timeout / cancellation**              | Via `WaitStrategy` + `AlertException` | Blocks forever, no exit                          |
| **`SequenceReportingEventHandler`** (mid-batch progress) | Yes                                   | Always publishes full batch                      |
| **EventTranslator** (structured publish API)             | Yes                                   | User manages ring buffer directly                |

The biggest functional gap is **WorkerPool**—many real-world use cases need work distribution (one event to one
handler), not just fan-out. The biggest robustness gap is the inability to interrupt a blocked `Reserve`.
