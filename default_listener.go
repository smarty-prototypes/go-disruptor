// defaultListener is not goroutine-safe and is designed to run on a single goroutine. It tracks which slots or
// events in the associated ring buffer have been read, processed, or handled in some manner. The fields are as
// follows:
//
//   - running: an atomic flag indicating whether the listener is running (0) or closed (1). Checked on each
//     iteration of the listen loop to determine when to exit.
//
//   - handledSequence: the sequence position up to which this listener's Handler has processed. Updated after each
//     successful call to Handle, making the listener's progress visible as part of a larger barrier (group of
//     sequence values) to other downstream parties--either a group of Listener instances or looping back to the
//     configured Sequencer.
//
//   - committedBarrier: a barrier representing how far all producers (via the configured Sequencer instance) have
//     committed. The value is read on each iteration to detect when data has been written but the prior Handler
//     group has not yet advanced. This means that this Listener is in a "gated" state and that new work is
//     imminent.
//
//   - upstreamBarrier: a barrier representing the minimum sequence position across the prior Handler group. The
//     value is read on each iteration to determine how far this Listener is allowed to advance. If this instance is
//     part of the first Handler group, the value points directly at the committed barrier of the configured
//     Sequencer.
//
//   - waiter: the WaitStrategy whose Gate and Idle methods are called during the gated and idle states
//     respectively.
//
//   - handler: the Handler whose Handle method is called when each batch of sequence values is ready to be
//     processed.
