// The Sequencer tracks the state of a given "writer" or producer to the ring buffer. It is the heart of the Disruptor
// pattern. When a caller desires to push events to the ring buffer, the caller or producer must first Reserve the
// desired slots on the ring buffer using the Sequencer. After obtaining a reservation on certain slots of the ring
// buffer, the caller must write the desired data to the reserved slots of the associated ring buffer and then
// indicate the completion of the operation(s) by calling Commit which makes the data in the written slots available
// to any downstream Handler instances which then handle or otherwise consume events from the ring buffer on different
// goroutines.
type Sequencer interface {

	// Reserve claims the desired number of slots in the ring buffer for the caller. When those slots become available
	// because any configured Handlers have properly processed all necessary data in those slots, the Sequencer returns
	// the uppermost or highest sequence of the slots claimed and reserved for the caller.
	//
	// The lower-bound sequence in the ring buffer is obtained by subtracting the specified number of slots from the
	// uppermost sequence returned. If the number of desired slots is larger than the capacity of the ring buffer,
	// ErrReservationSize is returned.
	//
	// Each successful call to Reserve should *always* be followed by a single call to Commit.
	Reserve(slots uint32) (upperSequence int64)

	// TryReserve attempts a single non-blocking reservation of the desired number of slots. If the slots are
	// immediately available, the uppermost sequence is returned. If the ring buffer has insufficient capacity
	// because consumers have not yet advanced far enough, ErrCapacityUnavailable is returned without waiting.
	// For the shared Sequencer, this uses a single CAS attempt rather than atomic Add.
	//
	// Each successful call to TryReserve should *always* be followed by a single call to Commit.
	TryReserve(slots uint32) (upperSequence int64)

	// Commit indicates to the Sequencer that the previously claimed slots in the ring buffer have been written to
	// successfully and that the data is now available to any configured Handler instances to process.
